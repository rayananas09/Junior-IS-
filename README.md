The goal of this project is to spearhead the development of a sophisticated machine learning model for accurate house price prediction in response to the problems that the real estate sector faces. By combining a strong machine learning assisted house price prediction model with a friendly user experience, this industry promises to reap revolutionary advantages. Access to precise and data driven information enables stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and investors, to make informed decisions. This strategy, with its user friendly platform, increases pricing strategies, reduces time on market, and increases overall customer happiness. Investor risk is also decreased, and real estate brokers that employ those nice technologies gain a competitive boost market transparency.
